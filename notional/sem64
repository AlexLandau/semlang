Fields to include (in approximate order):
- Magic number
- Number of functions
- Number of structs
- Number of unions
- Number of interfaces

- (Indices of definitions/implementations within the file, to enable selective loading?)

- Identifiers of upstream entities used (should this identify the modules and their versions as well?)

- (Parameter counts/types for each type definition? Whether they are supposed to be threaded?)

- Struct type definitions
- Union type definitions
- Interface type definitions
- Function type definitions

- Function implementations
- Struct requires-block implementations

A prereq to building the real version of this is likely enumerating and documenting all the things that
are checked during validation, and figuring out when they should happen during sem64 loading (so things
can be sorted accordingly).
